mml likes programming and thinking about computation.  It's back to a
recreation instead of a vocation.

Fun things:
- Scheme
- BASIC
- Perl 5
- puzzles
- relational/logic programming (MAGIC!)
- compilers and interpreters

A little curious about:
- using "high" languages to do "low" things
  - like making Scheme work on a microcontroller
  - like writing a bootloader in OCaml
- partitioning hypervisors
